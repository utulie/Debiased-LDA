This is the code for modified Linear Discriminant Analysis leveraging a debiased $\beta$ estimator. Through maximizing accuracy ($(TP+TN)/N$), an estimator of $\beta$ could be obtained. However, there exists a difference between $\mathbb{E}(\hat{\beta})$ and $\beta$. By debiasing it, a modified LDA could be obtained.
